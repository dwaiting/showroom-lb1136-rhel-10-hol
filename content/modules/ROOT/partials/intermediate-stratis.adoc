= *Storage Management* (stratis)

[discrete]
== *Skill Level: Intermediate*




== Overview

WARNING: These exercises build upon the exercises performed in the fundamental storage management unit.  It is necessary to complete those prior to attempting this unit.

== Getting Started

For these exercises, you will be using the host `node2` as user `root`.

From host `bastion`, ssh to `node2`.

[{format_cmd}]
----
ssh node2
----

Use `sudo` to elevate your privileges.

[{format_cmd}]
----
[[ "$UID" == 0 ]] || sudo -i
----

Verify that you are on the right host for these exercises.

[{format_cmd}]
----
workshop-stratis-checkhost.sh
----

You are now ready to proceed with these exercises.

== Core Concepts

In this unit you will be exposed to some more advanced concepts for storage management including:

  + how to grow an active storage pool, and 
  + how to add a cache device

Again, please be sure to have completed the fundamental exercises first.

== Grow Storage Pool

Stratis also makes it easy to add space to a pool.  Suppose the “summitfs” filesystem is growing close to the physical space in “summitpool”.  Adding an additional disk/block device is done using:

[{format_cmd}]
----
stratis pool add-data summitpool {disk3}
----

[{format_cmd}]
----
stratis blockdev
----

[{format_cmd_output}]
----
Pool Name    Device Node    Physical Size   Tier
summitpool   {disk1}                5 GiB   Data
summitpool   {disk2}                5 GiB   Data
summitpool   {disk3}                5 GiB   Data
----

Verify that the pool shows the additional space, and that the amount used is now in a safe range.

[{format_cmd}]
----
stratis pool
----

[{format_cmd_output}]
----
Name                          Total Physical   Properties          UUID
summitpool   15 GiB / 590.65 MiB / 14.42 GiB      ~Ca,~Cr   4b86ce9b...
----

== Add Cache Device

Stratis also makes it easy to add cache devices.  For example, say the filesystem we just created runs into some I/O performance issues.  You bought an SSD (solid state disk) and need to configure it into the system to act as a high speed cache.  Use the following commands to add the drive {disk4} and check its status:

[{format_cmd}]
----
stratis pool init-cache summitpool  {disk4}
----

[{format_cmd}]
----
stratis blockdev
----

[{format_cmd_output}]
----
Pool Name    Device Node    Physical Size   Tier
summitpool   {disk1}                5 GiB   Data
summitpool   {disk2}                5 GiB   Data
summitpool   {disk3}                5 GiB   Data
summitpool   {disk4}                5 GiB  Cache
----



== Conclusion

This concludes the exercises related to stratis.

Time to finish this unit and return the shell to it's home position.
