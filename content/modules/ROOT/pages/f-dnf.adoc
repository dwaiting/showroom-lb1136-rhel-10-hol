= Fundamental Package Management

== Overview

Software packages in RHEL 10 are managed with a tool called *dnf*.

Introduced in 2013, *dnf* was a significat improvement to it's predecessor *yum*.  Landing in RHEL 8, *dnf* replaced *yum* while still maintaining a great deal of compatability.

When compared to YUM, DNF offers:

    * better functionality
    * better performace and scalability
    * better dependency resolution
    * consistent (strict) API adherence
    * compatability with YUM

== Getting Started

For these exercises, you will be using the host `node1` as user `root`.

From host `bastion`, ssh to `node1`.

[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
ssh node1
----

Use `sudo` to elevate your privileges.

[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
[[ "$UID" == 0 ]] || sudo -i
----

Verify that you are on the right host for these exercises.

[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
workshop-dnf-checkhost.sh
----

You are now ready to proceed with these exercises.
