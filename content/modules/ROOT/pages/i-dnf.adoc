= Intermediate Package Management

== Overview

You have already been introduced to *dnf* and the fundamentals of package management.  Now we'll progress to more sophisticated capability of *dnf* and management of the repositories that back the highlevel tools.


=== Repositories

DNF operates on the concept of package repositories, commonly referred to as repos.  

    * System can have a single or many repos configured

Repos typically fall into 2 categories:

    * Traditional - static pool of packages organized into structured filesystem for local or remote access

    * Managed / Service - service that provides dynamic managed repos (ex: Red Hat Satellite)
