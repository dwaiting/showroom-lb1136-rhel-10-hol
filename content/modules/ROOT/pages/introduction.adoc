== Presented By

  * Christoph Doerbeck
  * Eddie Chen
  * Gordon Keegan



== Welcome

First of all, THANK YOU for registering and participating in *The Definitive Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10 Hands-on Lab*.  The lab team has worked very hard to assemble a series of exercises to introduce many of the new features and capabilities found in the next great release of RHEL.  We hope you enjoy this experience.

  * Please don't hesitate to ask questions
  * Please don't forget to review this session at the completion of this lab

Your reviews and feedback help keep labs like this as top attractions for events like the Red Hat Summit in the future.

NOTE:  This whole effort is done using official Red Hat software and although things can likely be set up to work with upstream software components (Fedora, CentOS-Stream, etc...), alternate derivatives of RHEL are not tested or validated with these exercises.



== Workshop Abstract

Welcome to The Definitive RHEL10 Hands-On Workshop.  This session will lead you through a mix of self-paced and proctored exercises covering selected fundamental, intermediate and advanced capabilities of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10.  Presented by your talented Red Hat field solution architects, key areas covered include:

    * Fundamental: Web Console, Package Management, Services, Firewall, Storage and intro to RHEL Lightspeed
    * Intermediate: expanded Package Storage & Services topics, Containers, Virtualization, Image Builder, troubleshooting with RHEL Lightspeed
    * Advanced: NFTables, eBPF Tracing, KPatch, TLog, Boot Management, Bootable Containers, LEAPP Upgrades

And plenty more... There will be ample experts on hand to assist you and answer your questions. Join us and begin your journey to
becoming a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10 expert.



== Guiding Principles

For the most part, each unit is independant of the others.

Units are designed to:

    * Introduce a topic
    * Provide a few activities to build understanding
    * Be fun wherever possible
    * Point you to help or additional info
    * Be executed in 10-15 minutes

Units are NOT designed to:

    * Prepare you for an RHCE or RHCSA exam
    * Go deep into a specific technology
    * Build muscle memory by forcing you to type everything out
    * Put you to sleep

== How to Proceed

Once the setup playbooks have completed, you can proceed directly to topics that interest you the most.  

  * Use the catalog on the left with drop-down arrows to select the units 
  * If you want to follow a sequential *learning path*, exercises are conveniently grouped *By Skill Level* or *By Category*

If you elect to follow a *learning path*, you can use the navigation icons at the bottom of each unit to advance to the 'Next' unit in your path.

It's up to you.  Ask questions and enjoy!
